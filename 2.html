    The C in CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.is an abbreviation for , because the way in which the style properties of the upper element are inherited to the child elements resembles a waterfall in the DOM tree structure. However, as an exception, box model-related properties such as margin, padding, and border are not inherited. Of course, you can force inheritance by giving it an inherit value.
